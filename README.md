![GitHub tag (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/hatamiarash7/openapi-generator?color=%2300baba&label=Marketplace&logo=github) [![Test](https://github.com/hatamiarash7/openapi-generator/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/hatamiarash7/openapi-generator/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This GitHub Action allows you to automatically generate code using the OpenAPI Tools generator. The OpenAPI Tools generator provides a set of powerful features to generate client SDKs, server stubs, documentation, and more from your OpenAPI specification file.

## Usage

Here's an example workflow that demonstrates how to use this GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: Generate Code from OpenAPI

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  generate_code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Generate code
        uses: hatamiarash7/openapi-generator@v0.2.0
        with:
          generator: python
          openapi-file: example.yml

      # Do anything you want with the generated code
      - name: Do anything
        run: ...
```

## Inputs

| Name            | Type     | Default          | Description                                                                         |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generator`     | Required |                  | The name of the generator to use e.g. "typescript-angular"                          |
| `generator-tag` |          | `latest`         | The Docker tag of the `openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` image to use             |
| `openapi-file`  |          | `./openapi.json` | The path to the OpenAPI document                                                    |
| `openapi-url`   |          | `UNSET`          | If set, the OpenAPI document will be loaded from this URL instead of `openapi-file` |
| `config-file`   |          | `UNSET`          | The path to the config file to be passed along to the generator                     |
| `template-dir`  |          | `UNSET`          | The path to the folder containing the template files                                |
| `output-dir`    |          | `UNSET`          | The path to the folder where the generated files will be placed                     |
| `command-args`  |          |                  | Additional arguments to pass through to the generator                               |

> **Note:** The default output directory is `./{generator}-client`. If you want to change this, you must set the `output-dir` input. You can also use an empty string `""` to write your files to the root of your repository.
